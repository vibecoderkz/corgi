# Discussion System Setup Guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Setup Required

The discussion system requires additional database tables that need to be created in your Supabase project.

### Step 1: Run Database Schema

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `discussion_system_schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will create:
- `discussion_groups` table
- `discussion_posts` table  
- `post_votes` table
- `notifications` table
- All necessary indexes
- Database functions for points and statistics
- Triggers for automatic updates
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Step 2: Add Sample Data (Optional)

1. In the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the content from `sample_discussion_data.sql`
3. Run the SQL script

This will add some sample discussion groups and posts for testing.

### Step 3: Verify Tables

Check that these tables were created in your Supabase database:
- ‚úÖ `discussion_groups`
- ‚úÖ `discussion_posts`
- ‚úÖ `post_votes`
- ‚úÖ `notifications`

### Step 4: Test the App

After running the SQL scripts:
1. Restart your Flutter app
2. Navigate to the Community screen
3. You should now be able to:
   - View discussions
   - Create new discussions
   - Post messages and replies
   - Vote on helpful posts
   - Earn points for helpful votes

## üîß Required Database Functions

The schema includes these essential functions that the app depends on:
- `user_has_course_access(user_id, course_id)` 
- `user_has_module_access(user_id, module_id)`
- `user_has_lesson_access(user_id, lesson_id)`
- `get_trending_discussions(limit)`
- `get_discussion_stats(group_id)`

These should already exist from your main database schema, but if not, you'll need to create them.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Error: "Table doesn't exist"
- Make sure you ran `discussion_system_schema.sql` completely
- Check the Supabase logs for any SQL errors
- Verify all tables are visible in the Table Editor

### Error: "Function doesn't exist"
- Ensure you have the user access functions from your main schema
- Check if RLS policies are properly applied

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Verify RLS policies are set up correctly
- Make sure users are authenticated
- Check that users have access to the courses/modules/lessons
